How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I feel okay about this content thus far.

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I want to spend more time googling the slice method and understanding what it means to use negative values as part of this method.

How many array methods are there within javascript?
